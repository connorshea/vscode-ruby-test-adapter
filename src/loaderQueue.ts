 * to a halt. We can't change that fact that the async file resolvers notify us about files individually, so we use
 * this queue to batch them up.
 *
 * When a test item is enqueued, the async worker function is woken up, drains the queue and runs all the enqueued
 * items in a batch. While it is running, any additional items that are enqueued will sit in the queue. When the
 * worker function finishes a batch, it will drain the queue again if there are items in it and run another batch,
 * and if not it will wait until more items have been enqueued
